# FYP-Project
This project aims to assist Malaysian farmers in selecting the most suitable and profitable vegetable crop based on environmental factors (soil, weather) and market trends (weekly price data). The system uses Random Forest Machine Learning and is integrated into a Flutter-based mobile application that provides real-time recommendations.
